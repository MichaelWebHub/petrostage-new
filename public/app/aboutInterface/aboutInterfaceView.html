            “PetroStage” is a part of the “SPE Connect Now!” project – an initiative to overcome the communication barriers between students of SPE (Society of Petroleum Engineers). The project was launched by eight SPE student chapters (AGH Krakow, Poland; Alexandria University, Egypt; Gubkin University, Russia; Montanuniversität Leoben, Austria; RWTH Aachen University, Clausthal University of Technology, both Germany; University of Kansas, USA; University of Zagreb, Croatia) in November 2016 at the “Oil and Gas Horizons” Congress in Moscow (Russia) with the support of the 2018 SPE International President, Mr. Darcy Spady.

            One of the main goals of the project is to collect information about all international events, organized by and for students, in one place which will always available for everybody. This is why “PetroStage” was created. We hope that “PetroStage” will expand networking opportunities for students and help organizers raise their events to a completely new level!
